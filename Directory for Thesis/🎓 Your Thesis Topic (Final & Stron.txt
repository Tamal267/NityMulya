“AI-Enhanced Complaint Management System for Government-Regulated Marketplaces: A Bengali NLP Approach for Validity Detection, Priority Classification, and Sentiment Analysis.”

This covers:
✔ Complaint system
✔ NLP + ML
✔ Bengali sentiment analysis
✔ Valid vs invalid complaint detection
✔ Priority tagging
✔ Real-world government context (DNCRP style)
✔ System + research + implementation → all-in-one

🧱 Full Thesis Structure (Chapter-wise)
Chapter 1 — Introduction

Explain:

Why price-regulated markets need strong complaint systems

Problems: Fake complaints, vague complaints, abuse, manual triage

Why Bengali NLP is difficult (low-resource language)

Goal: Create an AI system that:

checks validity of complaint

assigns priority automatically

performs Bengali sentiment analysis

Research Questions (RQs)

RQ1: Can NLP classify valid vs invalid complaints automatically in Bengali language?

RQ2: Can sentiment analysis improve priority prediction of complaints?

RQ3: Which model (TF-IDF, SVM, LSTM, BanglaBERT, XLM-R) performs best for Bengali complaint classification?

RQ4: How well does AI improve the complaint resolution process in regulated marketplaces?

Objectives

Build a complaint submission system

Apply NLP preprocessing for Bengali

Train ML models for:

Validity classification

Priority prediction

Sentiment analysis

Deploy API or dashboard for result visualization

Chapter 2 — Literature Review

Topics to cover:

1. Complaint Management Systems

Digital governance systems

Public service platforms

E-governance complaint handling

Case studies: India Grievance Portal, DNCRP, Bangladesh Digital Center

2. NLP in Low-Resource Languages

Bengali language challenges

Tokenization problems

Lack of datasets

Previous works on BanglaBERT / Bangla sentiment datasets

3. Sentiment Analysis & Text Classification

Rule-based

Machine learning (SVM, NB)

Deep learning (LSTM, GRU)

Transformer models

4. Price-controlled market studies

Customer rights

Fair price regulation

Importance of complaint verification

Chapter 3 — Methodology

This is your main chapter, show the full pipeline.

1. System Workflow
Complaint Text → NLP Cleaning → Valid/Invalid Model → Sentiment Model → Priority Model → Dashboard

2. Dataset Design

You will create a custom Bengali complaint dataset:

Field	Description
text	complaint description
label_validity	valid / invalid
sentiment	positive / negative / neutral
priority	low / medium / high
category	price, quality, behaviour, fraud

Dataset size target:

1500–3000 manually labeled complaints (synthetic + real mixture).
You can generate synthetic data to expand.

3. NLP Preprocessing for Bengali

Steps to write in thesis:

Unicode normalization

Removing stopwords (Bangla stopword list)

Tokenization (BNLP, IndicNLP)

Lemmatization

Handling spelling variation

Normalizing English/Bangla code-mix

4. Machine Learning Models Tested
Baseline Models

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

TF-IDF + SVM

Naïve Bayes

Deep Learning

LSTM

Bi-LSTM

GRU

Transformer Models (Modern)

BanglaBERT

BanglaBERT Large

XLM-RoBERTa (Multilingual)

You will compare all these.

5. Experiments to Run

You need three main experiments:

Experiment 1 — Complaint Validity Classification

Goal: Detect fake/unreasonable/vague complaints.

Output:

valid / invalid

Model:

BanglaBERT classifier

Experiment 2 — Sentiment Analysis

Goal: detect emotion level → anger/frustration → priority

Classes:

Positive

Neutral

Negative

Experiment 3 — Priority Prediction

Goal: Low / Medium / High

Inputs used:

complaint text

sentiment score

complaint type

Model:

Multi-class classifier

Chapter 4 — System Design (Your App + API)

Show your Flutter + Node/PHP/Dart backend:

Complaint Submission API
static Future<Map<String, dynamic>> submitComplaint({
  required String shopOwnerId,
  required String complaintType,
  required String description,
  // NLP model will process here
})

Admin Dashboard

Displays:

sentiment score

predicted priority

valid/invalid

complaint category

recommended action

Chapter 5 — Results & Evaluation
Metrics to Use

For all models:

Accuracy

F1-score

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve

Expected Findings

BanglaBERT > Logistic Regression > LSTM

Sentiment helps in prioritization

Transformers achieve 88–93% accuracy on Bengali complaint classification

Complaint system efficiency improves 40–60%

Chapter 6 — Discussion

Explain:

What worked well

Challenges with Bengali language

Why fake complaints follow certain patterns

How sentiment strongly correlates with high-priority issues

Ethical concerns (AI shouldn't auto-reject without human review)

Chapter 7 — Conclusion

Summary:

Built full complaint system

Built Bengali NLP pipeline

Achieved high accuracy

Improved government complaint handling efficiency

Future Work

Voice complaint → Speech-to-Text

Multi-label classification (multiple issues)

Real-time model retraining

Integration with government inspection teams

💥 Final Thesis Contribution Statement

Add this in abstract or intro:

This thesis introduces the first integrated Bengali NLP-based complaint validation and priority prediction system tailored to government-regulated marketplaces. Through a custom-labeled dataset, sentiment analysis, and transformer-based models such as BanglaBERT, the system significantly improves the reliability, transparency, and efficiency of consumer complaint management.
