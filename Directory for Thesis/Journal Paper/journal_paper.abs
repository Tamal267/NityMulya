Government marketplaces in Bangladesh receive thousands of complaints from citizens every day. Most of these complaints are written in Bengali, which makes manual processing difficult and time-consuming. Officials struggle to read, understand, and categorize all complaints quickly, leading to delays in response time and citizen dissatisfaction. An AI-enhanced complaint management system has been developed that uses BanglaBERT, a state-of-the-art Bengali language model, to automatically read, understand, and categorize complaints. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to extract important information from complaints, classify them into appropriate categories, and route them to the correct department for quick action. The system has been evaluated using 512 real complaints and high accuracy has been achieved in sentiment analysis, priority detection, and category classification. The results show that complaints can be processed in seconds, significantly reducing response time and improving citizen satisfaction. This research contributes to the growing field of Bengali NLP and demonstrates practical applications of AI in government services.
