# Import Path Case Sensitivity Fix

## Issue Description
The welcome screen was experiencing compilation errors due to incorrect import path case sensitivity:

```
lib/screens/welcome_screen.dart:3:8: Error: Error when reading 'lib/Screens/customers/product_detail_screen.dart': No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
- Import path used `Screens` (capital S) instead of `screens` (lowercase s)
- This caused the file not to be found during compilation
- The ProductDetailScreen class was then not available, leading to method not found errors

## Fix Applied
Changed the import statement in `/lib/screens/welcome_screen.dart`:

**Before:**
```dart
import 'package:nitymulya/Screens/customers/product_detail_screen.dart';
```

**After:**
```dart
import 'package:nitymulya/screens/customers/product_detail_screen.dart';
```

## Files Modified
- `/lib/screens/welcome_screen.dart` - Fixed import path case

## Verification
- ✅ Flutter analyze now passes (only minor deprecated warnings remain)
- ✅ Flutter build web completes successfully
- ✅ ProductDetailScreen is now properly imported and accessible
- ✅ Navigation to ProductDetailScreen works correctly

## Impact
- Resolved compilation errors preventing app launch
- Welcome screen can now properly navigate to product detail screens
- All existing functionality preserved

## Related Files
- Product detail screen: `/lib/screens/customers/product_detail_screen.dart`
- Welcome screen: `/lib/screens/welcome_screen.dart`

This fix ensures consistent file path casing throughout the project and resolves the import issues that were preventing successful compilation.
