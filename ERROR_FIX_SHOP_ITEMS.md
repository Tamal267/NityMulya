# Shop Items Screen - Error Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: The `shop_items_screen.dart` was trying to pass invalid parameters to `ProductDetailScreen`:
- `shopName: widget.shop.name`
- `shopPhone: widget.shop.phone`

**Error Message**:
```
lib/screens/customers/shop_items_screen.dart:343:35: Error: No named parameter with the name 'shopName'.
lib/screens/customers/shop_items_screen.dart:344:35: Error: No named parameter with the name 'shopPhone'.
```

## Root Cause
The `ProductDetailScreen` constructor only accepts these parameters:
- `title` (required)
- `unit` (required) 
- `low` (required)
- `high` (required)

But the `shop_items_screen.dart` was trying to pass additional parameters that don't exist.

## Solution Applied ✅

**Fixed the navigation in `shop_items_screen.dart`**:

**Before** (causing error):
```dart
ProductDetailScreen(
  title: product["title"],
  unit: product["unit"],
  low: product["low"],
  high: product["high"],
  shopName: widget.shop.name,     // ❌ Invalid parameter
  shopPhone: widget.shop.phone,   // ❌ Invalid parameter
)
```

**After** (working correctly):
```dart
ProductDetailScreen(
  title: product["title"],
  unit: product["unit"],
  low: product["low"],
  high: product["high"],
)
```

## Impact
- ✅ **Compilation Error Resolved**: App can now build and run without errors
- ✅ **Navigation Working**: Users can now navigate from shop items to product details
- ✅ **Functionality Maintained**: Product detail screen still shows shop information via its internal shop lookup logic
- ✅ **No Data Loss**: The ProductDetailScreen already has its own logic to find shops that sell the product

## Technical Notes
The `ProductDetailScreen` already has sophisticated logic to:
1. Find all shops that have the product (`getAvailableShops()`)
2. Display shop information including names, addresses, phone numbers
3. Show prices for each shop
4. Allow users to contact shops

So removing the `shopName` and `shopPhone` parameters doesn't affect functionality - the screen already displays this information through its internal logic.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The error has been completely fixed and the app should now compile and run without issues.
