## 1.6 Target Devices & Constraints

- Mobile-first (Android emphasis), Web compatibility via Flutter Web.
- Network variability: must degrade gracefully (caching planned).

## 1.7 Usability Goals

| Goal                                  | Metric Target                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Task success (core flows)             | >90% without external help      |
| First-time complaint submission       | <2.5 min                        |
| Navigation clarity (role dashboards)  | SUS equivalent >70              |
| Error recovery (failed network calls) | Clear action prompts in <1 step |

## 1.8 Known Constraints

- Large monolithic screens hurt learnability.
- Inconsistent role naming increases cognitive overhead.
- Environment config duplication (base URLs) may confuse evaluators.

## 1.9 Evaluation Scope

Included: Customer pricing journey, complaint submission, review creation, shop owner inventory update, wholesaler restock coordination.
Excluded: Advanced reward logic (not yet built), media persistence for reviews (future).
