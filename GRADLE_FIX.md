# Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) Version Fix

## Issue Resolved âœ…

**Problem**: Flutter build was failing with Android Gradle Plugin version compatibility issues:
- Current AGP version: 8.1.0 
- Required AGP version: At least 8.3.0 (or 8.2.1 for Java compatibility)
- Error: JdkImageTransform execution failed due to Java version compatibility

**Error Message**:
```
Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.1.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.3.0 soon.

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':shared_preferences_android:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
```

## Root Cause
1. **Outdated AGP Version**: Using AGP 8.1.0 which has known issues with Java 21+ compatibility
2. **Java Version Mismatch**: The build system was using older Java version settings
3. **Kotlin Version**: Using older Kotlin version (1.8.22) that may not be fully compatible

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated Android Gradle Plugin Version
**File**: `android/settings.gradle`

**Before**:
```gradle
plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
    id "com.android.application" version "8.1.0" apply false
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.8.22" apply false
}
```

**After**:
```gradle
plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
    id "com.android.application" version "8.3.0" apply false
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.9.22" apply false
}
```

### 2. Updated Java Compatibility Version
**File**: `android/app/build.gradle`

**Before**:
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

**After**:
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
}
```

### 3. Verified Gradle Wrapper Version
**File**: `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
- âœ… Already using Gradle 8.9 (compatible with AGP 8.3.0)
- No changes needed

## Changes Summary

| Component | Old Version | New Version | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Android Gradle Plugin | 8.1.0 | 8.3.0 | âœ… Updated |
| Kotlin | 1.8.22 | 1.9.22 | âœ… Updated |
| Java Compatibility | 1.8 | 11 | âœ… Updated |
| Gradle Wrapper | 8.9 | 8.9 | âœ… Already Compatible |

## Compatibility Matrix

âœ… **AGP 8.3.0** + **Gradle 8.9** + **Java 11** + **Kotlin 1.9.22**

This combination is fully supported and resolves the JdkImageTransform and Java compatibility issues.
