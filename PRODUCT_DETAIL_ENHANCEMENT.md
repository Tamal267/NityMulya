## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. `ProductDetailScreen` receives product details from `HomeScreen`
2. Calls `ShopService.getMockShops()` to get all available shops
3. Filters shops using `availableProducts.contains(title)`
4. Generates mock prices with realistic variations
5. Displays shops in scrollable list with all relevant information

### Mock Data
The implementation uses mock data from `ShopService` which includes:
- 5 sample shops across Dhaka
- Various shop categories (গ্রোসারি, সুপার শপ, পাইকারি, খুচরা)
- Product availability mapping
- Shop ratings, verification status, and contact information

### Code Quality
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Follows Flutter best practices
- ✅ Proper error handling for empty states
- ✅ Clean, readable code structure
- ✅ Responsive UI design

## User Experience
Users can now:
1. **View Product Details**: See comprehensive product information
2. **Find Nearby Shops**: See which shops have the product available
3. **Compare Prices**: Easily compare prices across different shops
4. **Contact Shops**: Get contact information and call shops directly
5. **Make Informed Decisions**: Use ratings, verification status, and location data
6. **Track Prices**: View historical price trends
7. **Set Alerts**: Get notified about price changes
